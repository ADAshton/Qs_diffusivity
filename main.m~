% This code takes in a shoreline wave buoy data and outputs wave climate info, Qs, and diffusivity
% input is long and lat of shoreline, WaveWatch3, and WIS data
% only difference for using UTM is that "stretching" step is not needed.

%% Part 1: WAVES

%%%%% WIS and WW3 -- This only needs to be done once for each shoreline. Then saved data can be reused.
% here, we take WIS data and wave watch 3 data and save them as wave roses
% input is WIS and WW3 data as a table format saved in its own folder
% output is matlab files of computed wave climate info using CERC formula

inputFolder_WW3 = []; % where is your WW3 data?
outputFolder_Waves = []; % where do you want the wave roses to go?
ShorelineAngle_init = []; % where the shoreline angle loop starts
saveWW3data(inputFolder_WW3,outputFolder_Waves,ShorelineAngle_init)

inputFolder_WIS = []; % where is your WW3 data?
outputFolder_Waves = []; % where do you want the wave roses to go?
saveWISdata(inputFolder_WIS,outputFolder_Waves,ShorelineAngle_init)

%%%%% compute wave climate -- this only needs to be done one time for a set of WIS & WW3 stations
outputFolder_Waves = [];
outputFolder_waveclimate = [];
plot_on = 1; % 1 to make plots, 0 to not
computewaveclimate_CERC(outputFolder_Waves,outputFolder_waveclimate,plot_on)


%% Part 2 shoreline + diffusivity and Qs calculations
%%%%% load shoreline data
% need long and lat points of the open ocean coast
% load data as data_raw, an nx2 matrix of long and lat data
data_raw = [];

%%%%% shorefixer
% this function makes continuous coastline from fragmented segments by
% joining expoints of segments less than TOL distance apart.
tol = 0.01; % in degrees, change to m if UTM
SLdata = join_cst(data_raw,tol);


%%%%% open ocean only
% here, create a variable of the indices of open ocean shoreline points (not in an estuary
% or on the backbarrier). I haven't figured out a way to do this that isn't
% by hand yet.
ind_all = 1:length(SLdata);
ind_open = []; % if all points are open coastline, ind_open = ind_all;
% 
% ind_open = [1504:1687 2109:2161 5014:-1:4984 5145:5149 4815:-1:4775]; %cape cod example


%%%%% stretch
% convert long and lat to x and y
%the below conversion factors are calculated for 41.8 degrees latitude, a
%central point along the cape, by a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
%calculator:
%http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/Calculators/degree.html
lat = 111.069; % cape cod example
lon = 83.110; % cape cod example

SLdata(:,1) = (SLdata(:,1)-min(SLdata(:,1))) * lon;%changed from lon/lat*lon to just lon
SLdata(:,2) = (SLdata(:,2)-min(SLdata(:,2))) * lat;

%%%%% detrend
% rotate shoreline so that it is flat, land is down and ocean is up

% Confirm that the shoreline is mostly oriented up. If not, first rotate by 180
% degrees using the rotate180 function.
% [Xrot,Yrot] = rotate180(SLdata); % uncomment if needed






%% Part 3: calculate sediment flux and diffusivity given shoreline and wave climate
